# /ˈsæːdoʊ/ (Signed Application Do)

Sado is an application designed to _securely_ and _programmatically_ grant TCC permissions to macOS executables in launchd and interactive contexts.

## Examples
If `$sado` is the location of the Sado executable (e.g. `$sado=/Applications/Sado.app/Contents/MacOS/Sado`)

```sh
# If you don't have a sado profile installed by your administrator,
# you can change your list of allowable commands for testing.
# A sado command must have a name, the full path of an executable and arguments.
$ $sado add-command my_echo /bin/echo test
$ $sado add-command my_true /usr/bin/true
$ $sado list-commands
Available commands:
my_true: ["/usr/bin/true"]
my_echo: ["/bin/echo", "test"]

# Now, we can run one of these commands with sado:
$ $sado run /bin/echo test
test

# But a command without exactly matching arguments is not runnable
$ $sado run /bin/echo hello there!
["/bin/echo", "hello", "there!"] not in a valid command

# You may also run a command by giving its name
$ $sado run-by-name my_true

# Clearing the list is trivial if it is not admin-enforced
$ $sado clear-commands
$ $sado list-commands
No available commands.

# And sado will "fail open" if has been given no configuration.
$ $sado run /bin/echo "I'm a bad command!"
I'm a bad command!
```

## Managing Sado via MDM
Sado uses the bundle identifier to look up the configuration, which defaults to com.facebook.cpe.Sado. You con enforce values for this with a configuration profile with the PayloadType that matches the bundle identifier (com.facebook.cpe.Sado).
```xml
  <key>PayloadContent</key>
  <dict>
    <key>ValidCommands</key>
    <dict>
      <key>run_true</key>
      <array>
        <string>/usr/bin/true</string>
      </array>
      <key>run_echo</key>
      <array>
        <string>/bin/echo</string>
        <string>hello</string>
        <string>there!</string>
      </array>
    </dict>
  </dict>
```

## Requirements
Sado requires macOS 11.0 or later.

## Building Sado
Sado can be built in Xcode, or in the terminal using `xcodebuild`.

To build Sado.app, run
```sh
$ xcodebuild -project 'Sado.xcodeproj' -scheme 'Sado'
```
and to build the Sado binary, to test; run
```sh
$ xcodebuild -project 'Sado.xcodeproj' -scheme 'SadoBinary'
```
